# Movie
Welcome to the Movie App! This is a web application that allows you to search for movies using an external API and create and manage movie reviews using a backend API. The app provides a seamless integration of frontend and backend components to enhance your movie browsing and reviewing experience.

# Features
* Movie Search: You can search for movies using the API integration. Enter a movie title or keyword, and the app will fetch relevant movie information, including title, release year, plot, and ratings.

* Movie Reviews: Once you find a movie you like, you can create a review for it. The backend API handles the storage and management of movie reviews, allowing users to provide their opinions, ratings, and comments.

* User Authentication: To ensure security and personalized experiences, the app includes user authentication functionality. Users can sign up, log in, and log out to access and manage their movie reviews.

* Connect Frontend to Backend: The frontend and backend components of the app are connected to enable a seamless flow of information. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch movie data, submit reviews, and retrieve user-specific information.
